			<strong>Having problems with the plugin? No panic, our support is quite fast and reliable!</strong>
		</p>		
		<p>
			To get a fast solution you should fill a support ticket on our platform, before that <strong>prepare these basic but important informations</strong>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>URL of the page with the gallery;</li>
			<li>describe the problem you are experiencing;</li>
			<li>browser and operating system used.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Another great help from you would be doing a couple of tests, try these simple operations and let us know the results: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Switch to the default WordPress theme and look if the problem is still there, if not we'll already know that the problem is related to your theme and we can be faster solving the issue;</li>
			<li>See if the problem is repeatable, also on another computers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>The more complete these informations are, the faster we'll be our response</strong> (time zone permitting), thanks!</p>
