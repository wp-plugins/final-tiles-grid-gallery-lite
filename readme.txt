The best wordpress grid gallery , you can say goodbye to the old-looking galleries based on squares, columns or rows.

== Description ==

Build galleries like a puzzle, not only you get awesome layouts, but it's also funny!

= A Brand New Algorithm =

There are dozens of wordpress galleries out there, but the problem is that they always look the same!
Final Tiles Grid Gallery uses a brand new algorithm to make much more interesting grids, how does it work?
The main concept is very simple: don't crop the images and keep the original size (when possible). 

This is a completely new way to build galleries because now you can think of the images like they were
the tiles of a puzzle with different sizes, so you can use a bigger size for a cover image, for example.

The gallery is fully responsive and it adapts to the browser using a nice and smooth animation, even on
mobile devices because it can use the hardware acceleration taking advantage of CSS3 properties.

This plugin is perfect for you if you need:

* a wedding album
* a desinger portfolio
* a photography portfolio
* a products showcase

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The layout doesnt' look correct =

Check the console of the browser and look if you see any error like: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function jquery.finalTilesGalleryLite.js
This errors means that the browser doesn't know the finalTilesGalleryLite JavaScript plugin, most of the time the problem is caused by a wrong jQuery
inclusion by the theme or another plugin. 

= Why the images arrange themselves in columns ? =

Columns happen when the bottom edges of the images are not aligned. To avoid this tedious layout you can raise the "Grid size" setting. This will crop a few pixels but it raises the chances to avoid columns.

= How to get beautiful grids ? =

Have a look at this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNT4JGjtyrs)


= Why does some image look blurry ? =

Under some circumstances the images have to be enlared a bit to avoid gaps. To avoid a blurry effect you can decrease the "Image size factor" setting. 

= I want to use another lightbox instead of the provided one =

The PRO license bundles 6 different lightboxes. However you can use any other lightbox you want also with the Lite license. If you have installed a lightbox plugin then you just need to select "Direct link to image" in the "Lightbox" settings.

= How can I get support? =

* Free support is included only with a PRO license: http://www.final-tiles-gallery.com/wordpress/pro.html
